So I visited the United States of America in October-November. And as a something I got the chance to be able to visit some of the offices of the tech companies in the Silicon Valley. I was able to visit the officesf Dropbox, Google and Scribd. Some of the worth mentioning points are:
<!--more-->
* The awesome environment that the developers work in. If the environment is awesome the code produced is gonna be great too. And it does not stop there, it can go on and be made noteworthy.
* The perks are many. Laundary service being provided to the employees is awesome. The employees don't need to care about what are the chores
