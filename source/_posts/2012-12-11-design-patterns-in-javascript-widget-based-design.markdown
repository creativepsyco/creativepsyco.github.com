*One of the most important things people learn after doing/learning a new language or as-these-days a framework is to be able to apply one of the most sought after industrial practices in the form of design patterns.*

The current semester I had a course involving hefty use of Design Patterns. The course CS3213-Software Design revolved in using design patterns and applying them to the world of software in extreme detail, which I never in my dreams would have imagined.


This is just great.
