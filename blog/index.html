      <p><a href="https://circleci.com">CircleCI</a> is a very nifty cloud-hosted continuous integration tool. It allows you to write your code with the peace of mind that you have. You can setup testing for every push, every pull request, every git tag and so on. You can upload to <a href="http://hockeyapp.net">HockeyApp</a> or [Fabric][3]. Everything gets tested, leaving you to write the best code possible.</p>

<p>For device testing on CircleCI you will need to spin up an emulator, however, you can&rsquo;t really spin up <code>x86</code> images on the CircleCI containers because they cannot provide <a href="https://discuss.circleci.com/t/provide-kvm-in-container/1179">KVM</a>. As such you are left with ARM emulators which are notoriously extremely slow and end up causing flakiness in testing. Here are some tools which I regularly use to troubleshoot Android Emulators on CircleCI.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.android.com/versions/lollipop-5-0/">Android Lollipop</a> was released back in Google I/O reflecting the new Material Design philosophy. It was followed soon by the AppCompat Library updating to <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.sg/2014/10/appcompat-v21-material-design-for-pre.html"><code>v21</code></a>. The Library brought in a new Action Bar pattern called <code>Toolbar</code> which behaves more like a custom view with a promise to customize the look and feel of it instead of the quirks of the <a href="http://cyrilmottier.com/2013/05/24/pushing-the-actionbar-to-the-next-level/">ActionBar</a>. The Action Bar was both less customizable and hard to style. With Toolbar some of it goes away as the Toolbar behaves more like a view group and you can initialize it with various different views which previously you could not.</p>

      <p>###Android Studio on Mac OSX Yosemite
I recently migrated to Mac OSX Yosemite and discovered that when I booted Android Studio I could not start it up since a JVM was not found on the machine. I was running 1.0RC3 version of Android Studio, and did not have this problem before, on Mavericks. I knew I had a JVM installed.</p>

<p>Here is an interesting problem. Let&rsquo;s say you are in a particular view, and you want to be able to set a background. You simple use the <code>View.setBackground(Drawable)</code> or <code>View.setBackgroundDrawable(Drawable)</code> call to do this. However once you do this, you realize that whenever the soft keyboard is opened it pushes your view to the top/resizes it such that your background looks squished.</p>

      <p>After getting the 4.3 update my Samsung Galaxy S3 started having [weird battery problems][1], it was a high I moved to a custom ROM since they were a lot stable than a few years back and offered a much better stock Android experience without any bloated software than device OEMs put inside.</p>

<p>In this post, I shall roughly tell you how I installed a custom on my Samsung Phone.</p>

      <p><em>Reposting this from my [FB feed][4]</em></p>

<p>##TL;DR
Don&rsquo;t put your FB username and password within mobile apps when you don&rsquo;t have the native FB app installed!</p>

<p>Today I learnt that the Facebook SDK for Android is very insecure. At first I thought Man in the Middle attacks on the SDK OAuth authentication process is not possible, but if you are embedding someone else&rsquo;s WebView within your own App via the SDK, you can very well control them, either via Reflection, or just by modifying the SDK code coz FB makes the SDK a public download which you then compile to link in your app. If the SDK does not find the FB app installed on a user&rsquo;s phone, it resorts to using the fallback mechanism of using an embedded WebView for authentication.</p>

      <p>While there may be different kind of development strategies floating around the merge vs rebase git model, one thing is for sure, you would at the end of the day want a clean merge from the contributors so that it can be tracked tested and cherry-picked if it needs to. This is where pull-requests are so effective.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-pull-request:5b8f1cbfeee9b0492484fb1331403a95">What is a pull-request?</h2>

<p>From the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">Official Github Guide</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pull requests let you tell others about changes you&rsquo;ve pushed to a GitHub repository. Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pull requests are useful in the shared repository model where contributors can work on different topic branches and then file a pull request to be able to initiate discussion about potential changes which does not need to affect the rest of the project.</p>

<h2 id="example:5b8f1cbfeee9b0492484fb1331403a95">Example</h2>

<p>Here is an <a href="https://github.com/square/wire/pull/81">example</a> of a pull request I filed for Square&rsquo;s Wire open source project.</p>

      <p>A lot of times in Android you end up writing code like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">//---- Normal Code above ---
Runnable runnable  = new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Do something stupid
    }
}
// Singleton Handler Manager -- not an instance one, am I smart?
HandlerManager.getInstance().postDelayed(runnable, 20000); // Run this after 20 seconds! Delay processing of data
finish();
</code></pre>

<p>That is, cooking up a lot of <code>Runnables</code> and posting them on the Handler to be run after a period of time. It happens.</p>

<p>As our role as developers trying to get a feature done in time, sometimes these Runnnables are the only hope. However, this <code>Runnable</code> introduces a potential memory leak.</p>

      <p>The concept of [Protocol Buffers][protobuf] by Google is amazing.</p>

<p>###Why should you use it</p>

<p>Protocol Buffers is a serialization strategy, much like XML or JSON. A lot of mobile apps and web services make use of JSON for passing information. However, protocol buffers are inherently compressed formats and not intented for the human eye (readability wise). You should definitely take a look at it if you feel that you are using a lot of the mobile data or if the primary target group of your app is the domain of mobile. It however, makes sense to use them for internal RPC related APIs and communication channels.</p>

      How to hide Keyboard in the case of multiple Edit Text One common problem faced by people working on Android input field forms is that many a times there is a need to show/hide the keyboard when the person touches on some other part of the screen, other than the edit box itself. However, since the focus is retained by the edit box, even if the keyboard is hidden, its hard to actually detect when and where should you be hiding the keyboard.

      <p>###Custom Widgets
These days I have been working extensively on apps for the Android Platform. And one thing keeps coming back to me: Resuse of components and widgets. Although most of the time when you are doing simple apps, you don&rsquo;t really pay much attention to the type of design and navigation strategies (<code>SINGLE_TOP</code> activities vs <code>SINGLE_TASK</code> blah.. blah) but when you are faced with putting different kinds of components in a single view then you probably have shuddered to think whether you were better off accomplishing this as a separate widget of its own. As can be seen from Romain Guy&rsquo;s [Google IO Talk][googleio], developing custom views has its own significant advantages.</p>

<p>Some of the advantages are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>A piece of highly reusable component will be at your disposal</li>
<li>you will have fine-grained control over the lifecycle of the control/widget that you are developing, (For example, you can decide whether to load images from the network or display a dummy error image in a custom <code>ImageView</code> see <code>volley</code> [<code>NetworkImageView</code>][netio] for details)</li>
<li>Custom views prevent cluttering of code in a single view thereby making abstraction more powerful</li>
<li>Other general advantages due to code reuse</li>
</ul>

<p>So let&rsquo;s dive into how I managed to make a custom widget for one of the apps.</p>

      Do you make use of PhoneNumberUtils in your android project? If so, have you ever encountered this exception before? java.lang.RuntimeException: cannot load/parse metadata: /com/google/i18n/phonenumbers/data/PhoneNumberMetadataProto_MY at com.google.a.a.d.a(PhoneNumberUtil.java:619) If yes, chances are you are probably using [proguard][progaurd] to do the obfuscation of code. However, as this points out, proguard automatically also obfuscates the library files. However, the PhoneNumberUtils has a hardcoded path to the proto files. Therefore, one cannot rely on obfuscating the library&rsquo;s code.

      Setting up a unobstrusive development environment has its advantages. If you are one of those people who probably spend about 14 hours a day sitting in front of a monitor doing what-not, from testing to deployment and development, then read on. Otherwise you can spend some time reading an IBM justification of how and why a solid dev environment pays off. This post is about setting up a solid development environment on Ubuntu Linux 12.04 and contains bits and pieces of information of how a lot of things can be automated.

      ###Making use of shared preferences for storing information public boolean getStoredLoginState() { prefs = getSharedPreferences(PREF_NAME, MODE_PRIVATE); boolean state = prefs.getBoolean(B_LOGGED_IN_STATE, false); return state; } public void setLoggedInState(boolean isLoggedIn) { prefs = getSharedPreferences(PREF_NAME, MODE_PRIVATE); SharedPreferences.Editor editor = prefs.edit(); editor.putBoolean(B_LOGGED_IN_STATE, isLoggedIn); editor.commit(); } ###Making use of the redirection trick Let&rsquo;s say you want to make sure the user is logged in before giving him access to a particular activity view. What you can do is to check the status of the login token through a shared preference and send back an intent with the intent that the current view was invoked with via an extra Intent parameter This is the code for the invoker: public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.detail_view); if (getStoredLoginState() == true) { Intent intent = this.getIntent(); Log.i(TAG, &quot;DetailView onCreate recd position of item: &quot; + intent.getIntExtra(ITEM_ID, 10)); int pos = intent.getIntExtra(ITEM_ID, 10); // Set the text TextView textView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.textView1); textView.setText(&quot; &quot; + pos); } else { // not logged in Intent intent = this.getIntent(); Intent newIntent = new Intent(this, LoginActivity.class); newIntent.putExtra(REDIRECT_INTENT, intent); // newIntent.setAction(Intent.ACTION_MAIN); newIntent.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_HISTORY); startActivity(newIntent); } } And this is the login view code.

      <p>For my final year project in the School of Computing NUS I had to do something very exciting related to working with web apps. If you are familiar with online continuous integration environments like [Travis][travis] and [Jenkins][jenkins] then cracking this issue is a hen&rsquo;s egg. The thing that I was required to do was compile and run research programs within a webapp. That is, feed input to a program written in C, C++ etc. and get the output, display it to the user. All of this included a data repository which housed patient data.</p>

      <p>I have been busy lately doing my Final Year Project which comprises of building a web based service for processing analysis jobs on patient data.</p>

<p>I have developed the web service API using [Rails][rails] with MySQL being the backend database.</p>

<p>For deployment purposes I had no idea which of the web servers to run as such I naturally googled online and found people talking about [Capistrano][caps], a great way to have deployment scripts being run on the server.</p>

<p>I needed something simple, I had seen the advantages of using SVN and [Nginx][nginx] as a means to deploy by SSH-ing to the server. This keeps things simple and lends us as much control as we need. So I explored.</p>

      <p>In my current Final Year Project (FYP) for my undergraduate degree I needed to spawn processes and be able to store their state in the memory so that they can be started/re-started or stopped. I had previously gone about doing the same kind of operation in Java with a Singleton <code>ProcessManager</code> Class so I was pretty sure that such a pattern would exist in Python as well. Turns out, it is a [bad practice][link1] to do so.</p>

<p>Anyways, I could not figure out a better way to do this, so I stuck with Singletons. Moreover it got me the job done.</p>

Look up the instructions at the official website. ###Setting up of Source Directory Mozilla Code can be checked out from http://hg.mozilla.org. To set up a Thunderbird and Calendar clone on your local machine checkout the source code as bash$ hg clone http://hg.mozilla.org/comm-central This will create a comm-central directory in your local machine Now comm-central depends on a number of submodules which can be fetched by the following commands bash$ cd comm-central bash$ python client.py checkout This will fetch the submodules.

      ##Gist Recently while working on a vacation assigment I had to create an API in ASP .NET MVC. This was in order to create a booking system on top of the Google Calendar Event storage. Google provides 50000 calls per day free of chrage for the API so we thought this might work. But it also required some form of authentication to prevent the API facade from being misused. ##OpenId Well when you can&rsquo;t store the authentication result you need to think of some third party based authentication mechanism and OpenId is one those means.

      And now some random philosphical thoughts on what I think of India: my home I am an Indian from India. For most of us, the buck stop right there. I grew up just like the rest of the kids in my colony: I thought we as a Nation are huge, the best in the world. Buoyed by my sense of patriotism I even wrote a story about an army related incursion in Kashmir which got published in Champak.I knew I had a passion for writing.

      One of the most important things people learn after doing/learning a new language or as-these-days a framework is to be able to apply one of the most sought after industrial practices in the form of design patterns. The current semester I had a course involving hefty use of Design Patterns. The course CS3213-Software Design revolved in using design patterns and applying them to the world of software in extreme detail, which I never in my dreams would have imagined.

      Do you think there is a concept of smart cities? Well there is. Sort of. Engagement Platforms with Web 2.0 With the internet and all the social media buzz in the air, we have truly beein in the grip of a global phenomena. It does not need to affect us globally but rather can have local implications as well. Civic Engagement platforms are the means to realize that and although there are kickstarters for Civic Projects, why not put the responsibility in the hands of the citizens themselves.

      Most of the stuff is still under production, more details later Don&rsquo;t know why but these days I am hooked to Javascript. Perhaps that&rsquo;s coz I write way too much Javascript these days or maybe the world is really moving to the client side of things. Now I don&rsquo;t want to go into the details of the holy war of server side vs client side of things. However, I do find that client side stuff is very exciting not to mention that completely open.

      The Problem Sometimes we find ourselves wanting to be able to host a webserver to test out some HTML or javascript functionality. For example when Cross Origin Resource Policy (CORS) does not allow running of scripts from outside the domain of the webserver. The Solution The solution is a simple piece of node js script living in the directory. Surprisingly it is way way small javascript Sample NodeJS Script to run server var connect = require('connect'); connect.createServer( connect.static(__dirname) ).listen(8080); This would start listening for a request on port 8080 and then serve the files from the current directory.

      Admit it. There are so many times you wish that the localhost-ed version of the application that you are developing in BacboneJS just works. But it doesn&rsquo;t. And there is only one reason why it doesn&rsquo;t work. Cross Origin Resource Sharing Yeah, the big culprit is CORS. And here is how you circumvent it. This snippet assumes you are using Sinatra for deploying your Rails API. The Solution options '/*' do response[&quot;Access-Control-Allow-Headers&quot;] = &quot;origin, x-requested-with, content-type&quot; end This snippet will add a header to the response that will allow cross-origin javascript coming specifically from localhost to be able to call the server and get a response.

      <p>One of the things that new app developers do especially mobile ones, is that they give a step like flow to their users to enter data in a much more streamlined process by breaking it down into a number of steps and then load each one at a different time.</p>

<p>Sometimes having different pages of content causes us to think about loading them in a page like fashion. Thus there needs to be a <em>mediator</em> that can take care of the loading based on a few configuration variables.</p>

      Every post starts with a Hello World. Every code you write starts with Hello World. Then perhaps this should also. I have moved my blog to Github now with the intention of using more and more of Git and ruby for use in my daily life. I can&rsquo;t comment how much I am going to miss in this or how much I am going to gain, it is just a start and hopefully a start of something really new and tidy.
